	 <p> You do not arrive at the top of a 14'er at 4pm on foot by yourself if you're doing everything right; from a logistical prospective, you've very obviously done yourself dirty. For starters, going down is broadly speaking more dangerous than going up. Your quads have no idea what they're in for, mine hadn't yet. But for a brief moment, held onto just long enough to justify the trip, I was the tallest standing person in the lower 48 atop Mount Elbert at 14,440 feet. </p>

		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Having made that happen, I was in a pickle. My start point in Boulder that morning was three hours from the mountain.  I'm 18 and the furthest west I've ever been in a friend's car: an 'experienced' junior varsity grade cross country runner with a backpack full of snacks &amp; water that will lose a strap quarter-way up the mountain and a dull skinning knife for no other reason than to not feel entirely unarmed alone on the side of the tallest mountain east of the Rockies. Good mountaineering says I should have been on the path hours before now, if not daybreak; what goes up must come down. But I was not here for good mountaineering, I was here to climb a mountain given the resources at hand. So it was noon when I stepped onto a trail leading straight onto the mountain.
		</p> 
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I usually know, in an academic kind of fashion, I'm doing something stupid while I'm doing it. That said, I will usually also continue to do said thing until a physical reason presents itself not to. But this time in particular the stupid thing was itself the constant overcoming of physical obstacles I had placed in front of myself, so no logic stood between me and an ignorance-of-Good-Ideas fueled adventure cross-cutting this mountain. 
		</p> 
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are trails on Mount Elbert, I know this because I started on one. They're called switchbacks because they zigzag up the side, reducing stress on the body while adding length to the hike. After 40 minutes on the trail, I noticed that trail was no longer under my feet. Calmly, rationally, I tell myself  'This is okay, because I'm on a mountain right? My whole goal is to get to the top.' So I commit to hiking straight up the mountain, what I would later learn is called cross-cutting and in many places is illegal should you be reported doing so. I saw one other human on the mountain the whole day, and they were hundreds of yards away photographing birds, so as far as I know my transgression went unreported to the authorities. 
		</p> 
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So I'm walking straight up this mountain, running up a seventy degree slope at times, slowly killing my legs. Three quarters of the way up and suddenly my inbox starts filling up on my phone. An hour from civilization and thirteen hundred feet in the air, my phone has reception. I pass along a few texts and selfies, unaware that the altitude sickness is making my expression a little less than lucid. There's a canyon of giant boulders inhabited by some foxes, pidgeons at 13.500 feet, and warm snow on the ground. And then you're there, at the top; you did it, congratulations. Now get back down.
		</p> 
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was almost 4 in the afternoon. I was exhausted, on the top of a mountain by myself, and my car was like a single dead pixel on a tiny white square beyond the forest line. Sunddown was at 7, which was one hour less than it took to get up here, and I knew the advice was real now: going down was going to be more dangerous than getting up here. Gravity had it out for me, and my legs were precarious allies at the moment. The snow under my feet had melted and refroze so many times that a thick glacier lay flat down the peak for a couple hundred yards at a sixty degree angle, descending right into the hiking trail leading to the peak. Using my already very dull knife as a rudder, I knealt on my knees and leaned forward. My legs were only wet for twenty minutes after I crossed below into the treeline. 
		</p> 
		<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I zig zagged the first hour before reality became obvious. The sun was threatening to go behind the mountain and I had to make a choice: go down faster, or end up on this mountain for some time in the dark. I went faster, cross-cutting downward in a straight line toward the parking lot; falling with style. I targeted one tree after another, taking as much care as I could to decline momentum's pull, dropping to my butt the very moment I felt a loss of control. I covered the same distance in half the time. When the land levelled out I knew I had made it and a shudder of relief passed through as I saw with loopy delight the cars in the dwindling daylight.

	     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elbert"> Mount Elbert - Wikipedia</a>
	     <p> "Mount Elbert is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and the highest point in the U.S. state of Colorado and the entire Mississippi River drainage basin. The ultra-prominent 14,440-foot (4401.2 m) fourteener is the highest peak in the Sawatch Range and the second-highest summit in the contiguous United States after Mount Whitney. Mount Elbert is located in San Isabel National Forest, 12.1 miles (19.4 km) southwest (bearing 223°) of the City of Leadville in Lake County, Colorado. </p>
<p><b>The mountain was named in honor of a Colorado statesman, Samuel Hitt Elbert, who was active in the formative period of the state and Governor of the Territory of Colorado from 1873 to 1874. Henry W. Stuckle of the Hayden Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak, in 1874. The easiest and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A+ in mountaineering parlance. Mount Elbert is therefore often referred to as the "gentle giant" that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains." - Wikipedia </b></p>
